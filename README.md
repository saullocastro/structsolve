Structural Analysis Solvers
===========================

- Linear statics
- Linear buckling
- Free vibration
- Nonlinear statics using Newton-Raphson


ROADMAP
=======

Currently these solvers are pretty much compatible with the compmech/panels
module, such that future work should focus on generalizing this module to work
with other applications.
