Structural Analysis Solvers
===========================

- Linear statics
- Linear buckling
- Free vibration
- Nonlinear statics using Newton-Raphson
- Nonlinear statics using the Arc-Length method


ROADMAP
=======

Currently these solvers are pretty much compatible with my other repository
"panels", such that future work should focus on generalizing this module to
work with other applications.
